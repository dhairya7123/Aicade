## A Project for Internship at Aicade

### Done Significant Changes to the Game

## Changes Include:
- Corrected the player direction
- Corrected the spawn rates of the enemy
- Added animation for player movement. Earlier the sprite was static even while moving, but now I added a tilting animation
- Added a new type of enemy ("The enemy is a flying enemy spawns randomly")
- The flying enemy follows the motion of a sinusoidal wave
